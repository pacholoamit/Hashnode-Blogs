## A short love story: ReactJS & Vue, forbidden romance (chapter 1)


# Have you ever fell in love with someone and thought that she was the one? ðŸ’”

only to be proven wrong. Do you believe in love at first sight? That was the case between ReactJS and Vue. Allow me to tell you a story, a story of a man who fell in love with a framework and swore loyalty, only for that love and devotion to be taken away by another lover.

## In the beginning...
When I embarked on my web development journey, I started just like you and just like everyone else. We learned about the basic HTML and CSS then some vanilla Javascript. Eventually it got to a point where I wanted to take it to the next level. I wanted **"more"**

This greed of man both has its merits and consequences, on one hand we have ascended beyond the scope of possibilities. We wonder "What more is out there?", we have ascended the food chain and become the apex predators of our time. We have created vast and wonderful structures for our world. We have conceived the maths and sciences to aid us as tools in our voyage for nothing else than **"more."**

### How does this have anything to do with the story? ðŸ¤”

You will see my child, for us to understand the coveted love story of ReactJS and Vue, you must understand the underlying force that drives our species. The principle of Greed. You must understand that for every decision and choice we make is out of the fundamental principle of greed.

Greed is what drives us, greed is the reason we reach for the stars and travel to the depths of the ocean, a world unknown for the sole purpose of knowing **"more."**

## The principle of Greed ðŸ’µ

I was happy and content with HTML and CSS and Javascript but as I ascended my knowledge, the principle of greed has begun to  strike me.  "What more is there?", I asked myself as I gaze into the stars and fall asleep. The next day I went to the occult archives of the Google library and found of a woman named "React" that could provide me more. She was located in Silicon Valley past the north horizon of Facebook land.

The next day I set out to find this woman. It was a long and hard struggle but eventually after hours of walking, I had finally arrived. The home of React was bare, she lived on nothing but what she needed and nothing more. She wouldn't even have react-router bundled in her NPM package but when I saw her, I fell in love...

## My love for React ðŸ’–

When I saw her, I fell in love. She provided an easier way to reference components and implement them. I fell in love with her lifecycle methods. I fell in love with her simplicity and more so when I learned about lifecycle hooks. "She's the one", I told myself over and over. She accepted me and embraced my flaws, and I embraced her flaws as well. 

Her complexity intrigues me to this very day, and I will never forget all the moments we shared. All the moments we argued about either using class components or functional components for storing state. Life was simple, and life was good.

## When things fell apart... ðŸ’š

By this point, React and I have had a long relationship and we were content. My greed was extinguished and I craved nothing more than her bare-bones framework. However, over time as I browsed the knowledge archive of Dev.To and YouTube. I overheard a couple of scholars mentioning another framework. A framework, I had not seen or heard of before.

"Vue is the best framework.", the scholar remarked. When I heard this, my heart dropped to my stomach and the fires of passion lit within me burning brighter than a thousand suns. These words are blasphemy to the teachings of our Lord Ben Awad. Little did I know that these words would mark the beginning... The beginning of the long journey of my affair with VueJS, and at that very moment, the embers of greed was starting to form...
