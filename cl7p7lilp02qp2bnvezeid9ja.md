## Is this the end of localhost? VS Code Server Preview

We're going to take a look at VS Code Server which is currently in private preview. I'm going to walk you through the features of VS Code Server that I've already tested having used it for a few days. Features such as Github auth and port forwarding will be discussed in the video.

I'll also be talking about how we can host VS Code Server on our local home lab server. One of the features that VS Code Server does not implement yet out of the box is automatic start up. In this video, I provide steps on how we can automatically start VS Code Server so that it starts every time a system reboot occurs
